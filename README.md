# Comprehensive Analysis of IPL 2022 (Excel, Python & Tableau)

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project presents a multi-faceted analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 season. It leverages a powerful combination of tools ‚Äî Microsoft Excel, Python (Jupyter Notebook), and Tableau ‚Äî to provide a comprehensive 360-degree view of the tournament. From quick data aggregation in Excel to deep statistical analysis in Python and interactive visualization in Tableau, this repository uncovers key insights into team performance, player statistics, and match dynamics.

## üìä The Dataset

The primary dataset for this project is `IPL 2022.csv`, which contains detailed match-by-match information for all 74 matches of the season. Key data points include:

* **Match Details:** Venue, date, teams playing, and stage of the tournament.
* **Toss Information:** Toss winner and their decision (to bat or field).
* **Match Outcome:** Innings scores, wickets, match winner, and margin of victory.
* **Top Performers:** Player of the match, top scorer, and best bowler for each game.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Components & Dashboards

This project is structured into three main parts, each culminating in its own form of dashboard or visual analysis:

1.  **Microsoft Excel Analysis & Dashboard:** The `IPL 2022.xlsx` file is used for rapid data processing with PivotTables and creating foundational dashboards.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (Python Notebook):** The `IPL_Data_Analysis.ipynb` notebook provides a code-based, in-depth statistical analysis with its own set of visualizations.
3.  **Interactive Dashboard (Tableau):** A final, user-friendly Tableau dashboard offers a polished and interactive way to explore the key findings.

### Part 1: Analysis & Dashboard in Microsoft Excel

The `IPL 2022.xlsx` workbook is a self-contained analysis tool. It contains multiple sheets, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the tournament, which are combined into a visual dashboard using Excel charts and slicers to summarize team performance, toss impact, and player stats.

### Part 2: Analysis & Visuals in Jupyter Notebook

The `IPL_Data_Analysis.ipynb` notebook contains a deep dive into the dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It provides a more granular and statistically rigorous examination of the data, generating custom plots and charts that form a sequential analytical narrative.

### Part 3: Interactive Tableau Dashboard

For the most polished and user-friendly experience, the data is presented in a Tableau dashboard titled **"IPL 2022 Season Review."** This dashboard features several interactive views, including leaderboards for top players, a head-to-head team comparison tool, and geographical analysis of venue statistics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

* **Initial Analysis:** Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, Charts, Slicers)
* **In-Depth Analysis:** Python, Pandas
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Notebook Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Dashboarding:** Tableau, Microsoft Excel, Jupyter Notebook

## üìã How to Use This Repository

1.  **For Excel Analysis:**
    * Open the `IPL 2022.xlsx` file to explore the various analysis sheets and the main dashboard.
2.  **For Python Analysis:**
    * Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `jupyter`) installed.
    * Open `IPL_Data_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook/Lab and run the cells sequentially.
3.  **For Tableau Dashboard:**
    * If a `.twbx` file is included, open it with the free [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/download) application to view the interactive dashboard.
